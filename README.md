####foam-gl as a monolithic standalone library is deprecated. foam-gl is now part of [foam-lib](https://github.com/foam-lib). The webgl-part can be found [here](https://github.com/foam-lib/foam-context-gl).

#FOAM - A WebGL toolkit

Foam is a condensed collection of tools for building procedural graphics in WebGL. It tries to be as 'low'-level as possible (in a browser/js sense) whilst handling and abstracting repetitive tasks such as scene, animation loop and user input setup. Foam provides thin abstractions for commonly used scene-related objects such as cameras, textures, basic geometry, light and material representations as well as WebGL objects like shader programs, vbos, fbos and others.

*Foam requires strong knowledge in WebGL and shader development.* If you don't want to deal with shaders and just quickly display your mesh using some predefined material and lighting, this might not be the right tool for you.

##Advantages & Disadvantages 

- Foam has a very thin abstraction layer, which allows you to **safely access any 'bare-bone' WebGL functionality** you need (except shader program binding) without breaking any Foam internal states.
- Foam **focuses on writing shaders**. Unlike other libraries or frameworks you won't find any prepackaged materials, complex lighting and shadowing setups or post-processing filters. That's your job. – But there are small shader templates to help get you started.
- Although you can load external models, Foam mainly **focuses on generating geometry programmatically**.
- Loading every resource asynchronously on scene init can be quite cumbersome, especially when dealing with multiple glsl files, texture images and additional resources. Foam uses a **resource bundle loader** which you can feed with a list of resources. It will load all of them, report errors and after completely processing the list init your program with a resource dictionary. This is not mandatory, you can still load and process every single resource on its own.
- Foam offers **wrappers around WebGL base objects** such as programs, vertex and index buffers, framebuffers  and textures.
- Foam reintroduces the **fixed pipeline matrix stack model**. Welcome back: glTranslate, glScale, glRotate, glMultMatrix, glPushMatrix and glPopMatrix as well as some additional matrix transformation methods.
- It is sometimes necessary to quickly test a visual idea. Therefore, Foam offers an optional **'immediate mode' style**, which allows drawing mesh data and 2d & 3d primitives without previously allocating any object.
- Solid **text rendering of generated BitmapFonts** using the wonderful opentype.js – An OpenType and TrueType font parser.
- Foam uses the **common.js module pattern** via [browserify](http://browserify.org/)


##Goals

Foam tries to be as generic and structurally open as possible by not forcing you to adopt a certain way of building your scenes or managing the objects within it.
You may choose to use the built-in geometry or light representations or simply drop them and just use Foam for setting up your app and resources and write everything with raw WebGL calls. If you need a scene graph, build it on top. – This **flexibility is a core idea** of Foam. – Therefore *Foam will never compete with WebGL frameworks* like Three.js or others.

Additional functionalities may be added with extensions.



##Structure

- ***App core*** – Canvas setup, user input, resource bundle handling and update loop setup
- ***Graphics*** – Offers aforementioned cameras (perspective, orthographic, frustum and arcball rotation), generic material & light representations and geometric models which can be extended with custom attributes and uniforms, as well as text rendering, 'immediate mode' drawing via *glDraw*, and matrix stack manipulation via *glTrans*. Basic access to drawing methods, transformations and raw WebGL can be gained by inheriting from *glObject*.
- ***WebGL objects*** – Shader program, vbo, fbo, textures
- **Geometry** – Axis aligned bounding boxes, planes, rectangles, to be extended
- ***Math*** – 2d & 3d vectors, matrices, quaternions and utilities
- ***Extras*** – Colour representation, Filewatcher, WebWorker console



##Install

Context Node (not yet published)
    
    npm install foam-gl

Context html (browserified standalone)

    <script type="text/javascript" src="foam.js"></script>
  
    



##Usage

A typical project structure is as follows:


    project/
    |
    |-- src/
    |   |-- app.js        //your application
    |   |-- program.glsl  //the main shader
    |
    |-- index.html  //minimum html
    |-- bundle.js   //browserified app.js

With a **minimum html boilerplate**:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <script src="bundle.js"></script>
        <style>
            html,body{margin: 0;padding: 0;}
            canvas{vertical-align: bottom;}
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>


And **app.js**:

    var Foam = require('foam-gl');
    
    var CameraPersp = Foam.CameraPersp,
        Program     = Foam.Program,
        Texture     = Foam.Texture,
        Vec3        = Foam.Vec3;

    //inits app with ressources on window load 
    Foam.App.newOnLoadWithResources({ 
        // Resource obj
        shader : {path:pathToShader},
        image  : {path:pathToImage,type:'image'},
    },{ 
        // App obj
        setup : function(resources){
            this.setFPS(60); 
            this.setWindowSize(800,600);
            
            this._program = new Program(resources.shader);
            this._program.bind();
            
            this._texture = Texture.fromImage(resources.image);
            
            this._program.uniform1i('uTexture', this._texture.getUnit());
                
            this._camera = new CameraPersp();
            this._camera.setAspectRatio(this.getAspectRatio());
            this._camera.lookAt(Vec3.one(),Vec3.zero());
            this._camera.updateMatrices();
            
            var gl = this._gl;
            
            gl.viewport(0,0,this.getWindowWidth(),this.getWindowHeight());    
            gl.clearColor(0.25,0.25,0.25,1.0);
            gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);    
        },
        
        update : function(){
            var gl      = this._gl,
                glTrans = this._glTrans,
                glDraw  = this._glDraw;
            
            var camera  = this._camera;
            var program = this._program;
            var t = this.getSecondsElapsed();
            
            gl.clear(gl.BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BIT);
            
            camera.setDistance((0.5 + Math.sin(t) * 0.5) * 2.0);
            camera.updateViewMatrix();
            
            glTrans.setCameraMatrices(camera);
                
            program.uniform1f('uUseTexture',0.0);
                
            glDraw.drawPivot();
            
            program.uniform1f('uUseTexture',1.0);
            
            glTrans.pushMatrix();
            glTrans.translate3f(0,Math.sin(t * 0.5),0);
            glTrans.rotate3f(t,0,0);
            glDraw.drawCubeColored(); // draw test cube
            glTrans.popMatrix();
        }
    });
    
Which equals (regarding application initialisation):

    var Foam = require('foam-gl');
    
    function App(canvas,resources){
        Foam.App.apply(this,arguments);
    }
    App.prototype = Object.create(Foam.App.prototype);
    App.prototype.constructor = App;
    
    App.prototype.setup  = function(resources){}
    App.prototype.update = function(){};
    
    window.addEventListener('load',function(){
        var app;
        Foam.Resource.load(
            { // Resource obj
                shaderA : {path:pathToShaderA},
                shaderB : {path:pathToShaderB}
            },
            function(resources){
                app = new App(null,resources);
            }
    });

| -o   | path     | path of the new project                                     |
| -t   | template | glsl & app.js template: basic2d, basic3d, basic3dTexture, basic3dLight |            
| -s   |          | only creates app.js & program.glsl (optional)               |
| -w   |          | watchify app.js (optional)                                  |
